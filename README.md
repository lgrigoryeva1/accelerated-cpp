### C++ reading circle
Here you can find the code snippets from the reading circle where we read and discuss the "C++ Primper" book. 

We started with "Accelerated C++", but switched to a newer book, hence, the name of the repo is still according to the previous book. 

We have grouped chapters in the book into "chunks":

### Basics
1. Vectors
2. Namespaces
3. String
4. I/O

### Classes
1. Intro to classes
2. Classes
