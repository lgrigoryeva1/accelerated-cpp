18.13 When to use an unnamed namespace? 
18.14
18.15 Explain the difference
directive: using namespace std
declaration: std::cout

In a directive, every variable from the namespace std is available in local lookup, e.g. I can access "cin" and "cout" without writing "std" in front of it
In a declaration, I specify the namespace when I call its variable, e.g. std::cout 
The latter is preferred to avoid name collisions

18.16 Explain the following code
18.17
18.18
18.19
18.20
